         desc: '<p>I made this gingerbread house for a Wilton competition several years ago.</p>       <p>The structure is made of gingerbread that is connected with brown royal icing.  Before the gingerbread panels were connected, the window openings were carved out and filled with yellow royal icing and then covered in hot melted sugar that hardened as it cooled to form a glassy look.</p>  <p>The roof is made from wafer cookies.  The porch posts are candy canes and the railing is made from royal icing that was piped to the shape on wax paper and allowed to dry. The garland is green licorice strands and the bows are piped from red royal icing.  The porch base and front steps are made from graham crackers.  The lights along the gutter line are candy pieces and the front fascia above the second story balcony is covered in smarties candy pieces.  The evergreen trees are made from sugar cookies cut in variously-size star shapes and stacked from largest to smallest, connected with royal icing.  The shrubs are gum drops overpiped with green royal icing using a star tip.  The window trim and wreaths were also piped using royal icing.</p> <p>Santa, the snowman and the lamppost were made from fondant.  The bricks of the chimney surrounding Santa are made from Chicklets gum pieces.  Snowman\'s scarf is a piece of fruit rollup.</p>  <p>The house is approximately 12\" x 12\" x 12\".</p>'}
