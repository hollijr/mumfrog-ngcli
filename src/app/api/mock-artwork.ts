The garland is green licorice strands and the bows are piped from red royal icing.  The porch base and front steps are made from graham crackers.  The lights along the gutter line are candy pieces and the front fascia above the second story balcony is covered in smarties candy pieces.  The evergreen trees are made from sugar cookies cut in variously-size star shapes and stacked from largest to smallest, connected with royal icing.  The shrubs are gum drops overpiped with green royal icing using a star tip.  The window trim and wreaths were also piped using royal icing.</p> <p>Santa, the snowman and the lamppost were made from fondant.
